# PyStocks

Stock Price Analytics of Yahoo! Finance data on the top stocks by market cap.

I am primarily using the [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) framework and looking into [Greykite](https://github.com/linkedin/greykite) as well.

Currently deployed manually due to the 6hr limit on Github Actions, but there is a YAML file to setup build-on-push.

You should be able to see the book at:
